# When mem0-api in docker but db in host, use: host.docker.internal, ip address. On Docker Desktop for Windows or Mac, the DNS name host.docker.internal will resolve to the host machine's address by default, allowing container programs to access the host through this name. However, on Linux, Docker does not configure this resolution by default, and you should use the host machine's address directly.
